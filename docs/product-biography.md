## Introduction
This project was initiated by Jurjen Helmus from IDOLaad. The idea stems from the desire to gain more insights in the amount of times people try to charge their electric vehicle at a charging station, but fail to. This data would be valuable to accurately predict the amount of charging stations needed in Amsterdam by 2030 to meet the demand.
